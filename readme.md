Hello! my name is f10, im a lua/C/C#/python programmer.

this is my newest application, CB:RO

it is a multipurpose bot designed for the roblox game "Counter Blox" to send, recive and decline trades!
it is fully customisable, you can restrict items, send trades to specific people with specific items and alot more!
comes with a customisable chat message if someone puts an item you want or dont want in, can ask to add and much more!

i hope you enjoy,

-NOTE: THIS DOES INJECT INTO ROBLOX AND GO AGAINST TOS

please for the love of god read the instructions before crying to newera in discord
